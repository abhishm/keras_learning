In this reposiory, I trained a small image dataset using Keras high level api. I used three approaches:

- Create a Convolutional Neural Network from scratch and train it
- Use the VGG16 to get the features of the images and train a fully-connected neural network on it
- Combine VGG16 and the trained MLP in the previous example and fine-tune the results
